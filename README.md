# Peter's Park

## EXPLANATION
TODO

### Set up

`npm install`

### Running the tests

`npm test`

### Running the app

You can also view the app itself!

- `npm run dev`
- In your browser, navigate to http://localhost:8080/
- The stuff should hot-reload (meaning you don't need to refresh GENERALLY)

### What am I doing?
Mess around in these files
- TODO

For the components, Peter has initialized them as functional (dumb) components

However, if you think the component needs state (maybe the test spec tells you), then feel free to upgrade it to a class component. Just keep the structure of the exports roughly similar

If you touch anything else, Peter will scratch you
