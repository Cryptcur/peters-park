# Peter's Park

## What's up with this?
Help Peter set up his park!

Some practice with React, Redux, and React-Redux

THIS MAY NOT BE ENTIRELY PERFECT AND THERE MAY BE SOME HIDDEN OR STRAY BUGS SO PLEASE BE AWARE!

Make sure you read the comments everywhere (there are comments in the server files too if you need a refresher on that).

### Set up

`npm install`

### Running the tests

`npm test`

### Running the app

You can also view the app itself!

- `npm run dev`
- In your browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000/

You need to have written the store and components in order to view it though.

It's already connected together so everything needs to be written partially in order to not crash! Use to test specs to get up and running first.

### What am I doing?
Mess around in these files
- `src/client/components/AllCats.js`
- `src/client/components/CatCard.js`
- `src/client/components/SingleCat.js`
- `src/client/store/cat.js`
- `src/client/store/cats.js`

All the tests are located in the `tests/` folder in the appropriate subfolder

If you touch anything else, Peter will scratch you
